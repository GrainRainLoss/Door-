The mechanical structure of the stm32 single-chip microcomputer and the steering gear is used to complete the unlocking. And through the esp8266 module to achieve network communication for control. Some open source libraries of stm32 are used in the code. Some network deployments are also involved. 利用stm32单片机与舵机的机械结构完成开锁。并通过ESP8266模块实现网络通信进行控制。代码中利用了部分stm32的开源库。还涉及一些网络部署。
